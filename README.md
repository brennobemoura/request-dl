# RequestDL

This library came about through improvements in functionality 
and techniques of the library developed by Carson Katri called
[Request](https://github.com/carson-katri/swift-request).

Some features have been removed and others improved in an effort 
to make the code more declarative. In addition, we have gained in 
the handling of the return through the TaskModifier and Middlewares 
added in this version.

## Next steps

Here's the list of what's left to finish the first version of RequestDL.

- Implement unit tests;
- Implement support for Combine;
- Document code;
- Make the Targets available;

Feel free to open PRs and implement these features. After the first 
version becomes available, we will open to implement new features.
